## 📌 Project Overview

At GIKI, various campus operations — such as course management, class scheduling, lecturer assignments, and event bookings — are currently handled through separate manual processes or fragmented systems. This often leads to confusion, scheduling conflicts, and miscommunication between departments, faculty, and student organizations.

The **GIKI Campus Management System (CMS)** aims to provide a centralized digital platform for managing academic and campus-wide administrative activities. It allows administrators to assign classes to lecturers, schedule rooms, and approve club event bookings for fields or auditoriums. Students and faculty can view schedules, access course information, and stay updated on upcoming campus activities — all from a single, unified web interface.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Fragmented manual processes for campus operations at GIKI lead to:
- Scheduling conflicts
- Delayed communication
- Double-booking of venues
- Lack of visibility for rescheduled classes
- No unified event calendar
- Repetitive data entry for administrative staff

⚠️ Current Status (Prototype)
This is a demonstration prototype. The following limitations apply:

Data Layer
All dashboard information and component data are hard-coded arrays stored directly in frontend code

No external database, server, or API connection

No data persistence — refreshing the page resets all application state

Actions & Form Handling
All user interactions operate only on temporary local state

No backend validation or data saving

All changes disappear upon browser refresh

File Upload & Drag-and-Drop
File drop areas visually accept files and display confirmation messages

No actual file upload or storage occurs

All file interactions are simulated for demonstration

Notifications & Activity Feed
Timetable, analytics, announcements, and activity cards display pre-defined demo information

No real-time update mechanism (WebSockets or SSE)

Access Control
Two separate applications (Student View + Admin View)

Role switching requires opening the respective application

No login system, session handling, or authentication logic

🧪 Usability Testing (Milestone 3)
Test Scenarios
Task	Description
Task 1	Enroll in a new course and check your course list
Task 2	Upload an assignment for a course you are enrolled in
Task 3	As a teacher, create a new course and upload an assignment
Task 4 (Optional)	Book a study room for a class or group session
Observations
Task	Finding
Task 1	"Enroll in Course" button easily found, but confirmation location unclear
Task 2	Successful uploads, but file format instructions caused confusion
Task 3	Course creation successful, but users expected confirmation message
Task 4	Booking clear, but available time slots not easily noticed
Identified Usability Problems
Problem	Solution Implemented
Missing confirmation feedback after key actions	Added confirmation messages for enrollments, uploads, and course creation
Unclear file upload instructions	Prominently highlighted file format guidelines
Available slots for room booking not visually clear	Improved visual display of available time slots
🔮 Future Enhancements
Backend integration with database persistence

User authentication and role-based access control

Real-time notifications via WebSockets

Actual file upload functionality

API integration for external services

Mobile-responsive design optimization

Email notifications for approvals/rejections

Export functionality (timetables, reports)

Integration with university calendar systems
